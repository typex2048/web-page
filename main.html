<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p>
Cryptography or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós "hidden, secret";
 and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively[1]) is the practice 
 and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called 
 adversaries.[2] More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols 
 that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages;[3] various aspects
 in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and
 non-repudiation[4] are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the 
 intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, 
 communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, 
 chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.
